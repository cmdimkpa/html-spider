JavaScript framework to enable namespace-triggered application boilerplate generation and DevOps orchestration. The project will reside within our Web IDE which also includes a live render view and code collaboration. The Web IDE will communicate with the JavaScript client object in the browser, which will in turn transmit actions/updates to the server side.
